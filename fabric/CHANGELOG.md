- New Feature: **Resetting Trades**
    - You can now reset trades of villagers directly in the trading menu!
    - Click on the `Reset Trades` recipe to reset the trades of the villager.
    - **This feature is disabled by default!**: As it might be too overpowered,
      you need to enable it in the config first (`plugins/ClickVillagers/config.yml`)
      by setting `allow_resetting_trades: true`.
