- Fix: Exception thrown in console when removing a villager's anchor.
- Changed villager anchor sounds.
- Players will now need the `clickvillagers.pickup` permission to pick up
villagers they claimed as well.
  - A new config option `claimed_villagers_bypass_permissions` has been
  added to change this behavior if needed.
